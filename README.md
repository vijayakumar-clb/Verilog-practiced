Verilog Learning Journey 🚀
Started: Feb 20, 2026

I am learning Verilog from scratch using Kali Linux. This repository contains my daily practice codes and circuit designs.

Goals
 Understand Logic Gates
 Build Combinational Circuits (Adders, MUX)
 Build Sequential Circuits (Flip-flops, Counters)
 Learn Testbench writing
Daily Log

Day 1: Setup and Basic Gates
Configured Git on Kali.
Created my first Verilog module: AND Gate.### Day 2
- Learned basic Verilog syntax
- Learned how to compile with iverilog
- Learned how to view waveforms with GTKWave

## Day 2Projects
- `dff.v` — D Flip Flop module
- `dff_tb.v` — Testbench for D Flip Flop

## Tools Used
- OS: Kali Linux
- Compiler: iverilog
- Waveform Viewer: GTKWave

```
